Welcome to GKO95's GitHub Pages, my personal GitHub Pages for blogging and archiving information. Generated by Jekyll, this GitHub-Pages is made from scratch starting from theme design, scripts, and documentations which I have been doing it ever since 2015.

## Features
Here are some of the featured you can find on this GitHub-Pages:
* Light & Dark mode theme selection
* English & Korean language selection
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) & [KaTex](https://katex.org/) JavaScript library implementation

For those who are interested in my GitHub-Pages theme, sorry but I didn't designed this for the distribution purpose. But you are free to use the code I made.

### Fonts
The GitHub-Pages uses the following fonts:
* [JetBrains Mono v2.001](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)
* [Noto Sans KR](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans+KR)

Browse the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for your Jekyll, and select one or more font styles to be implemented. A new section will appear on the right; once finished selecting the font style, click on the *Embed* tab and copy & paste the `<link>` tag to head of HTML.

### Icons
Most of the icons in my GitHub-Pages are from [iconmonstr](https://iconmonstr.com/) and I love those simple designs!

### Syntax Highlight
For the syntax highlight, the GitHub-Pages use the [Rouge](http://rouge.jneen.net/) syntax highlighter with the [Monokai](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwarby/pygments-css/master/monokai.css) and [Default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwarby/pygments-css/master/default.css) styles.
